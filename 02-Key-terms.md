# Git & GitHub Key Terms

This file contains the most important Git and GitHub terms and their meanings.

## Repository (Repo)
A repository is a storage space for your project. It contains all your files, folders, and the history of changes made using Git.

## Branch
A branch is a separate line of development in a repository. It allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main code.

## Local Repository
A local repository is a copy of the repository on your own computer. You can make changes and commit them locally before pushing to GitHub.

## Remote Repository
A remote repository is a version of your repository hosted on a platform like GitHub. It allows collaboration and backup of your work.

## Commit
A commit is a saved change in your Git repository. Each commit has a message describing the change and records the author and time.

## Clone
Cloning a repository means making a full copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

## Push
Push is the action of sending your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Pull
Pull is the action of fetching and merging changes from the remote repository to your local repository.

## Pull Request (PR)
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch in a repository, usually from a feature branch into the main branch.

## Merge
Merge is combining changes from one branch into another, typically after a pull request has been approved.

## Staging / Index
The staging area (or index) is where you place changes before committing them. You add files to the staging area using `git add`.

## Conflict
A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches. It needs manual resolution.
