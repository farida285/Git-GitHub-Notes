# Introduction to Git & GitHub

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system that helps us track changes in our code.  
It allows us to save versions of our projects, go back to previous versions,  
and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform that works with Git and helps us manage and share our projects more easily.  
It allows people to see what we have worked on and makes collaboration smoother when working in a team.  

Nowadays, it is recommended that anyone who writes code learns Git and GitHub,  
because they help track changes, organize projects, and show our work to others.

## My Goal
I am using this repository to take notes while learning Git & GitHub,
so I can practice writing code and managing projects properly.
