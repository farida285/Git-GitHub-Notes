# Git & GitHub Installation and Setup

## 1. Download Git
The first step is to download Git from the official website:  
[https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)  

- Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
- Follow the installation instructions to complete the setup.

## 2. Setup Git
After installation, we need to configure Git locally:  
1. Open Git Bash (or Terminal).  
2. Set your name and email for your commits:   
git config --global user.name "Your Name"   
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

> These settings allow Git to associate your commits with your identity.

## 3. Check Git Version
To make sure Git was installed correctly, run:  
git --version

If it shows a version number, Git is ready to use ✅

## 4. GitHub Account
- You should create a GitHub account at [https://github.com](https://github.com) if you don’t have one yet.  
- This account will be used when you push your projects to GitHub.  
- Your GitHub account will automatically connect with Git when you do your first `git push`.

### Personal Advice
- It's recommended that anyone who writes code learns Git and GitHub from the start.  
- Git helps you **track changes, manage your projects, and organize your work**.  
- GitHub makes collaboration easier and lets people see your work.  
- Follow this order: **Download → Setup → Version Check → Create GitHub Account → First Push**.
